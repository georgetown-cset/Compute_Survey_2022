## 🗄️  Source data

This directory is for unprocessed and immutable source data. 

Code in the parent directory (see e.g. `data/main.py`) is responsible for fetching any such data not included in the project repo.
This might include files too large for GitHub.

Intermediate, transformed data are in `../interim` and final datasets are in `../final`.
